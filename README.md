# Labbox-ephys

**Under development** (and seeking helpers for this open source project)

Analysis and visualization of neurophysiology recordings and spike sorting results.

## Installation and basic usage

### Prerequisites

* Linux or MacOS
* Docker
    - For Linux, be sure that your non-root user is in the docker group
    - Recommended test from command line: `docker run hello-world`
* Python (>= 3.6)
* git

### Create directories and set environment variables

You will need to create a data directory. You can choose any location you want, but on Linux this could look like the following (where `<user>` is the name of the logged-in user):

* `/home/<user>/labbox/labbox-ephys-data`

Set an environment variable to point to this directory so we can refer to it elsewhere

```bash
# Adjust as needed to match above
export LABBOX_EPHYS_DATA_DIR=/home/user/labbox/labbox-ephys-data
```

Ensure that this environment variable is set with each new terminal session by adding that line to your ~/.bashrc file.

### Install/upgrade labbox-launcher

Note: it is recommended that you use a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or a virtualenv when using the `pip` and `python` commands. If you create a conda environment you should target Python 3.7 with Numpy.

Install the latest version of labbox-launcher

```
pip install --upgrade git+git://github.com/laboratorybox/labbox-launcher
```

This should make the `labbox-launcher` command available from the command line. If it is not available, you may need to check that the appropriate bin directory for installed Python executables has been added to your PATH.

### Launch the container

Launch the labbox-ephys container

First double-check that docker is installed properly: `docker run hello-world`

Then:

```bash
# On Linux:
labbox-launcher run magland/labbox-ephys:0.3.25 --docker_run_opts "--net host" --data $LABBOX_EPHYS_DATA_DIR

# On MacOS:
labbox-launcher run magland/labbox-ephys:0.3.25 --docker_run_opts "-p 15310:15310 -p 15308:15308" --data $LABBOX_EPHYS_DATA_DIR
```

### View in browser

Now, point your browser (chrome is recommended) to: `http://localhost:15310`

**Note: The terminal output may refer to different ports while starting up, but it is important that you use 15310**

### Optionally host a compute resource server for spike sorting

If you want to use your own computer to run the spike sorting, then you will need to set up a hither compute resource server. Instructions for doing this can be found in the "Job handlers" section of the "Config" page in the GUI.
