const text: string = "# Compute resource configuration\n\n|||\n|---|---|\n|Kachery node ID for this labbox:|`{nodeId}`|\n|Using compute resource:|`{computeResourceUri}`|\n\n## Using a remote compute resource\n\nTo configure labbox to use a remote compute resource, create a `labbox_config.yml` file in the base directory of the labbox_ephys repo with the following content:\n\n```yaml\n---\ncompute_resource_uri: feed://...\njob_handlers:\n  local:\n    type: local\n  partition1:\n    type: remote\n  partition2:\n    type: remote\n  partition3:\n    type: remote\n  timeseries:\n    type: remote\n```\n\nreplacing `feed://...` with the feed of the compute resource (see the section below for information on hosting a compute resource). You will also need to give permission for this labbox server to access the compute resource. For this, you will need the kachery node ID for this labbox, which is given above.\n\nAlternatively, you can set the LABBOX_EPHYS_CONFIG environment variable to point to a local or remote configuration file. For example:\n\n```\nLABBOX_EPHYS_CONFIG=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/......./raw/labbox-ephys-1.yaml\n```\n\n## Hosting a compute resource\n\nFollow these instructions for hosting the compute resource: [hosting a hither compute resource](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/hither/blob/master/doc/hosting_compute_resource.md)\n\nAs you run the configuration script, you will be prompted to give permission labbox-ephys to access this compute resource. You should provide the kachery node ID as provided above."
